This convergence reflects indecision, as price trades just below the shorter-term averages, which may act as near-term resistance.\n\nFrom a bullish perspective, a decisive move back above this cluster of moving averages would signal potential for upward momentum and a retest of higher resistance levels.\n\nFrom a bearish perspective, failure to reclaim these averages could leave XRP vulnerable to renewed selling pressure, reinforcing the current consolidative structure and opening the door for further downside within the range.",
