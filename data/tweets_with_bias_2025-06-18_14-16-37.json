    "text": "MAY ‚Äò25 @SMBCAPITAL TAKEAWAYS\n\n1. Product selection matters. Given the macro environment and opportunity set, many traders adapted by expanding into futures and options to capture the full range of opportunities. Oftentimes, the expected value of certain setups via options far exceeds that in the equity. Yes there‚Äôs a learning curve, but worthwhile for experienced traders.\n\n2. Daily chart filtering became a huge edge once market structure confirmed further upside. The best traders proactively scanned for continuation patterns and structured trades around them. Personally, this has always been a weaker area for me and something even I could do a much better job at.\n\nA lot of the swing traders on here like @RealSimpleAriel and others are far more adept at this than I am.\n\n3. If you hit a PNL PR in a month like June, which imo was far less opportunistic than May, odds aren‚Äôt it wasn‚Äôt just getting lucky. You leveled up. When your process gets sharper and you extract more from less, that‚Äôs growth in its purest form.\n\n4. Trading is really hard. You really need to be ok with getting the crap knocked out of you again and again. In order to do that, you do need to find a way to enjoy the process. Yes, there will always be absolutely awful moments of doubt and frustration. But if you can‚Äôt find a way to be motivated and appreciative of the experience‚Ä¶. It just isn‚Äôt going to happen or trading is meant to be a hobby. And that is totally ok too!\n\n5. I was absolutely floored by the quality of intern at SMB this year.
