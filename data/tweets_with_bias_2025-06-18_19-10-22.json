    "text": "MAY ‚Äò25 @SMBCAPITAL TAKEAWAYS\n\n1. Product selection matters. Given the macro environment and opportunity set, many traders adapted by expanding into futures and options to capture the full range of opportunities. Oftentimes, the expected value of certain setups via options far exceeds that in the equity. Yes there‚Äôs a learning curve, but worthwhile for experienced traders.\n\n2. Daily chart filtering became a huge edge once market structure confirmed further upside. The best traders proactively scanned for continuation patterns and structured trades around them. Personally, this has always been a weaker area for me and something even I could do a much better job at.\n\nA lot of the swing traders on here like @RealSimpleAriel and others are far more adept at this than I am.\n\n3. If you hit a PNL PR in a month like June, which imo was far less opportunistic than May, odds aren‚Äôt it wasn‚Äôt just getting lucky. You leveled up. When your process gets sharper and you extract more from less, that‚Äôs growth in its purest form.\n\n4. Trading is really hard. You really need to be ok with getting the crap knocked out of you again and again. In order to do that, you do need to find a way to enjoy the process. Yes, there will always be absolutely awful moments of doubt and frustration. But if you can‚Äôt find a way to be motivated and appreciative of the experience‚Ä¶. It just isn‚Äôt going to happen or trading is meant to be a hobby. And that is totally ok too!\n\n5. I was absolutely floored by the quality of intern at SMB this year.

Well, here‚Äôs more proof.\n\nKen Griffin recently said in an interview:\n‚ÄúNo. 1 is diversification. It‚Äôs very important to understand that your likelihood of beating the pros as a novice investor is low. It‚Äôd be like asking me to go out there and play football on an NFL team.‚Äù\n\nNothing could be further from the truth!\n\nLet‚Äôs be clear: diversification is not a strategy‚Äîit‚Äôs a crutch. It‚Äôs what you fall back on when you lack the skill, ability or discipline to manage risk precisely. It‚Äôs a hedge against ignorance.\n\nBut here‚Äôs the kicker: being small isn‚Äôt the disadvantage‚Äîit‚Äôs the edge. The problem isn‚Äôt that individual investors can‚Äôt beat the pros. The problem is that they imitate them. They adopt the same bloated, rigid, over-diversified tactics that cripple institutional portfolios.\n\nGriffin praises size and teams of analysts (that slow down decision making) as advantages, but it‚Äôs actually their Achilles‚Äô heel. The majority of these so-called pros can‚Äôt even beat the $SPY‚Äîbecause their sheer size restricts agility and concentration.\n\nThe real failure? Weak investment criteria. And promoting diversification as the No. 1 principle? Absurd.\n\nIf you‚Äôre serious about outperformance, stop listening to advice designed for capital constraints you don‚Äôt have. You‚Äôre not managing billions‚Äîyou can move faster, get in early, cut quickly, and scale aggressively. That‚Äôs your advantage.\n\nI discuss this topic in detail in my book Trade Like a Stock Market Wizard. \n\nminervini.com",
