    "text": "MY TAKE ON THE WINNERS IN THE NUKE STACK\n\nOver the past 2 years, AI went from buzzword to infrastructure priority. But while the world obsesses over chips, data, and models, they‚Äôre missing the constraint that matters most: power.\n\nThis is not a winner-take-all race. It‚Äôs winner-takes-layer. The real question is: which companies will own the power stack for AI -- the part enterprises will depend on to keep their data centers live and their models running 24/7?\n\nHere‚Äôs how it breaks down:\n\n$CCJ is the uranium linchpin. No enriched uranium, no new nuclear builds. Cameco is becoming the $TSM of nuclear energy -- controlling upstream supply as SMRs, Gen IV reactors, and data center power demand explode. Every AI model built on nuclear power begins with CCJ‚Äôs fuel.\n\n$CEG is the carbon-free backbone. It‚Äôs already delivering nuclear baseload power at scale -- and directly targeting AI hyperscalers with guaranteed, zero-carbon supply. As data centers demand 24/7 clean energy, Constellation is becoming their first call.\n\n$VST is the reliability layer. It‚Äôs upgrading legacy generation into firm, dispatchable power -- not future promises, but proven capacity. Vistra is becoming the $ORCL of energy -- a legacy backbone modernizing for the AI era. Not flashy, but indispensable.\n\n$OKLO and $SMR are the modular layer. If Oklo succeeds in making modular reactors as deployable and scalable as GPUs, it could become the distributed $NVDA of nuclear -- powering AI at the edge. Still early. Still risky. But conceptually, it‚Äôs the closest thing to NVDA-as-a-platform. NuScale is focused on grid-connected SMRs for campus-scale power. Think of them as the edge GPUs of energy: local, efficient, and designed to run where the grid can‚Äôt.\n\n$BWXT is the picks-and-shovels play. From microreactors to naval propulsion to enriched fuel, it‚Äôs the critical defense supplier behind the most secure parts of the nuclear stack. Think of it as the $ASML of nuclear -- delivering high-security, high-complexity systems that are essential and non-replicable.\n\n$GEV and $VRT are the infrastructure stabilizers. No power efficiency, no scale. GEV is optimizing how energy is delivered and consumed inside the rack. Vertiv is becoming the $AVGO of physical AI infrastructure -- managing power flow, thermal load, and uptime as data centers scale. Every hyperscale deployment depends on them to stay online -- and stay cool.\n\nThe point is: this isn‚Äôt a utility trade. It‚Äôs the rise of a new AI energy stack -- and the winners will be those who control the inputs (uranium), generation (nuclear and renewables), delivery (utilities), and edge (modular power).\n\nSkeptics say ‚Äúnuclear is too slow‚Äù or ‚ÄúAI demand is overblown.‚Äù But follow the capital -- the biggest energy contracts in history are now coming from $AMZN, $META, $GOOGL, and $MSFT, not governments. That‚Äôs not a future bet. That‚Äôs a signal. And it‚Äôs happening now.\n\nSo no -- this space isn‚Äôt hype. It‚Äôs just misunderstood. At @FuturumEquities, we believe the NUKE stack isn‚Äôt just part of the AI story -- it‚Äôs what makes it real.",

    "text": "Happy Juneteenth #Team42!\n\nToday is a day on which we ought to sit and reflect on the country we have been, the country we are, and the country we want to be.\n\nI believe that deep down, America is a godly country based upon godly principles. In an era of kings and feudal lords, it was radical to think that all people are created equal and that we all deserve liberty, the pursuit of happiness, and representation in government. Looking around the world, it still is a radical thought in many places. And in many cases‚Äîboth present and past‚Äîthese formerly radical principles have not applied to everyone here.\n\nLooking ahead, the country I love so much is clearly at a crossroads. But we have been here before. And if we conjure the spirit of the great godly men and women of yesterday, we can navigate this Fourth Turning polycrisis relatively well. \n\nThere will be some pain involved, but the juice is worth the squeeze. Because I do not want my children to grow up with crippling inequality and widespread poverty, which leads to rampant crime and government overreach, political chaos and inflation, and eventually, a crumbling empire. That is the risk if we allow our increasingly K-shaped society to fester.\n\nHere are my top five institutions that I believe will be up for serious debate and potential regime change as we trudge deeper into this Fourth Turning: \n\n1. The egregiously unfair treatment of capital income vs. labor income in our ultra-complicated tax code which features tens of thousands of pages of loopholes for rich people and corporations to weaponize and evade taxes at the expense of burdening poor people with more national debt. 10% flat tax anyone? I know God is in favor of it‚Äîit‚Äôs well documented in the Bible. \n\n2. The cultural obsession with putting profits over people. AI is bound to take our capitalism experiment to its logical extreme‚Äîand no economic system functions well for society at the extremes. Capitalism is not unique in this regard; we just haven‚Äôt gotten there yet. But we will in the next 5-10 years. Just watch. \n\n3. Globalization is another institution that is already being debated in this Fourth Turning. The low-hanging-fruit reason why is because of the adverse distributional impacts it has had on the US labor market and American society broadly‚Äîyet another example of putting profits over people. The high-hanging-fruit reason why is that we have lost faith in our own government‚Äôs ability to govern and keep us safe. How then can we trust the world beyond our borders? \n\n4. The size and scope of the money the federal government spends on entitlements (46% of total) and the peculiar ratio between what it spends on poor people (17% of total) and everything else (37% of total). The fight about this will get so intense that it will either destroy one of our two dominant political parties or it will force a third party to emerge as a dominant player. FWIW, I vote purple and am looking forward to the day where the loud voices on @FoxNews, @MSNBC, @Newsmax and @CNN finally realize that it‚Äôs counterproductive to keep screaming and pointing fingers at the other side‚Äîwhich is exactly what our oligarchic puppet masters prefer. Better us angry at each other than them. üíú\n\nThread: 1 of 2",

Especially the first time. \n\nI really enjoy the mental clarity and calmness that comes as a result.  I find that my senses improve and sharpen. \n\nHaving gone over 5 days in the past I figured out a few things.  One trick I learned is to appreciate the hunger signals from the gut.  Try to really think about the feelings generated at times.  There‚Äôs both neurochemical and electrical signalling that really stands out at times. \n\nOne that that works for me is to use my conscious thoughts and try to message my gut. Internally voicing things like ‚Äòwe aren‚Äôt eating for days‚Äô or ‚Äòautophagy is a powerful healer and good‚Äô‚Ä¶ ‚ÄòI don‚Äôt need to produce hunger signals‚Äô.   I tap my sides, where I might be hoping to lose a couple lbs and say internally ‚Äòlet‚Äôs eat this‚Äô\n\nIt‚Äôs pretty amazing how the body listens and responds.

    "text": "You‚Äôve probably heard me say it before: Most professional money managers give terrible advice to individual investors. Well, here‚Äôs more proof.\n\nKen Griffin recently said in an interview:\n‚ÄúNo. 1 is diversification. It‚Äôs very important to understand that your likelihood of beating the pros as a novice investor is low. It‚Äôd be like asking me to go out there and play football on an NFL team.‚Äù\n\nNothing could be further from the truth!\n\nLet‚Äôs be clear: diversification is not a strategy‚Äîit‚Äôs a crutch. It‚Äôs what you fall back on when you lack the skill, ability or discipline to manage risk precisely. It‚Äôs a hedge against ignorance.\n\nBut here‚Äôs the kicker: being small isn‚Äôt the disadvantage‚Äîit‚Äôs the edge. The problem isn‚Äôt that individual investors can‚Äôt beat the pros. The problem is that they imitate them. They adopt the same bloated, rigid, over-diversified tactics that cripple institutional portfolios.\n\nGriffin praises size and teams of analysts (that slow down decision making) as advantages, but it‚Äôs actually their Achilles‚Äô heel. The majority of these so-called pros can‚Äôt even beat the $SPY‚Äîbecause their sheer size restricts agility and concentration.\n\nThe real failure? Weak investment criteria. And promoting diversification as the No. 1 principle? Absurd.\n\nIf you‚Äôre serious about outperformance, stop listening to advice designed for capital constraints you don‚Äôt have. You‚Äôre not managing billions‚Äîyou can move faster, get in early, cut quickly, and scale aggressively. That‚Äôs your advantage.\n\nI discuss this topic in detail in my book Trade Like a Stock Market Wizard. \n\nminervini.com",
