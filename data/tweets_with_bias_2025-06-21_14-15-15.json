Neutron places Rocket Lab on the shortlist for the Pentagon’s NSSL Phase 3 contracts -- a multi-billion dollar procurement track historically reserved for large, vertically integrated primes. \n\nAnd Rocket Lab isn’t just competing on launch anymore. It’s assembling a full-stack space defense platform: Electron for responsive smallsat delivery, Photon as a customizable satellite bus, Geost for EO/IR intelligence payloads, and Mynaric for optical inter-satellite links.

That comparison misses the business model entirely. Starlink is a vertically integrated ISP, monetizing through hardware sales, subscriptions, and terminal deployments. AST isn’t chasing consumers -- it’s embedding into existing carrier networks as a wholesale roaming layer, extending mobile coverage without disrupting the stack.\n\nThis isn’t a new network -- it’s an overlay. AST connects directly to unmodified smartphones, routing through licensed spectrum and leveraging the billing rails of global MNOs. No hardware. No installs. No retail friction. And the spectrum it’s acquiring isn’t optional -- it’s regulatory infrastructure. The right to transmit, to integrate, and to monetize mobility without rebuilding the pipe.

Lithium systems like $TSLA Megapack top out at ~4 hours -- fine for peak shaving, but inadequate for load balancing across multi-day renewable gaps or supporting the rising base load volatility driven by AI.\n\nThat’s where Eos fits. Its zinc-based, non-flammable batteries target the 8–12+ hour segment and are already being deployed through a vertically integrated U.S. production line. As AI scales power demand and renewables increase grid variability, utilities will need storage that supports duration, safety, and domestic sourcing. Eos isn't a clean tech story.

As $GOOGL, $MSFT, and $AMZN transition from model training to real-time inference at scale, the constraint has shifted from compute throughput to power delivery. Legacy 54V architectures are no longer viable for Blackwell-class GPUs or sovereign LLM clusters.\n\nNavitas is co-developing 800V HVDC power delivery systems in partnership with $NVDA -- not as a parts supplier, but as a strategic design contributor. Its GaN and SiC platforms are already validated across hyperscaler applications, and the alignment with Nvidia’s reference design positions Navitas to become a standard in next-generation rack architecture.\n\nNvidia doesn’t form casual partnerships -- it shapes ecosystems. CUDA didn’t win by advertising -- it won by being written into everything. The same is happening here. If 800V HVDC becomes the baseline for AI-scale data centers, Navitas doesn’t compete for share -- it becomes part of the spec. More of a 2027 story.",

While most investors still treat eVTOLs as speculative consumer tech, Archer’s core opportunity lies in providing infrastructure for urban, contested, and distributed aerial operations -- a gap legacy defense primes are structurally unequipped to fill.\n\nOn the civilian side, FAA certification unlocks the urban air mobility market. On the defense side, Archer’s battery-native aircraft function as modular ISR and logistics assets -- deployable without runways, fuel, or heavy ground support. This dual-path model enables near-term revenue through DoD programs like Agility Prime, while preserving long-term upside tied to commercial airspace integration.

    "text": "Today's Morning Note:\n\nWe are heading into Friday with futures up on news about Iran coming to the table on uranium enrichment.\n\nBut the market has been losing upper momentum, and we are heading into a major options expiration today. \n\nWe could see some volatility, so traders are being more stock-specific with less risk on.\n\nIt's hard to tell if the next 2-5% in the $SPX will be up or down.\n\n$SPY played with the 8-day, and it's below for now, which gives some caution. See if it pops back up, which it's done a bunch of times in this sequence.\n\n$QQQ and tech are holding up better, which is important. As long as it holds the 527ish area, it's hard to get too bearish. Just need to be in the right names.\n\nWe caught a nice $IWM move into the $215 area, which we managed well. Early this week, some bought back on the Red Dog Reversal Monday at the $208 pivot.\nMegacap tech is very stock-specific.\n\n$MSFT grinded to an all-time high but has no setup. Had to just buy the 8-day.\n\n$NFLX is trending over 8/21-day. But can't really trade it through levels.\n\n$AMZN choppy but constructive if it holds the $209-$210 area. Resistance is closer to $218.\n\n$META is one of the stronger names and needs to hold $690. A move above $708 brings momentum here.\n\n$TSLA is building an inside wedge. It's very tricky at time but held support Wednesday. To get momentum, it has to get over $335 with volume.\n\nSemis/AI names are specific and a leading tell for tech.\n\n$CRWV got to the top of the go-to list since its IPO. Congrats if you caught the moves we outlined. It seems headed to $200, but be careful with sizing.\n\n$NVDA seems ready to go to the $150 area but is taking its time. It's beeen better to be long vs. the $142 area instead of adding on strength. Getting over $146.15 can drive the rally.\n\n$SMCI's chart got tight, so I bought options and stock early in the week plus the stock. It needs to clear $46.50 with big volume for a major momentum move.\n\nQuantum names gave levels earlier in the week to trade against.\n\n$IONQ needs to hold $36.03.\n$QBTS needs to hold $14.84.\n$QUBT needs to hold $16.45.\n\nAs long as these levels hold, buyers will step up.\n\n$DASH is a VTF® favorite and looks good. It held 215; 230+ can happen in a better market.\n\n$PLTR is a focus. We've been navigating it for months. Held where it had to as it makes new highs every few days to manage.\n\nOn Wednesday, I outlined a way to get long $CRCL. Some were long vs. the $145.88 gap pivot. Others bought when it got and stayed above $165.60. Now it's over $220+ to trim.\n\nWe focused on $COIN again. It had a nice channel that triggered Wednesday. Today's a day to trim and trail as it's up $6.\n\nBitcoin held the 50-day again. I got long $IBIT into support. It's up nicely this morning to trim, but it has more room higher.",

    "text": "XRP Price Coils Between Support and Overhead Resistance\n\nXRP is exhibiting significant price compression, trading in a narrow range as highlighted by the recent candlesticks. \n\nThe price remains below the cluster of key moving averages (20, 50, 100-day), which are acting as immediate overhead resistance. This posture is a caution for bulls, as failure to reclaim these levels can signal persistent weakness. The MACD indicator is also positioned below the zero line, suggesting bearish momentum is still present.\n\nConversely, the $2.00 level is acting as a clear area of support. So long as the price holds above this psychological floor, a base could be forming. A decisive break above the moving averages might indicate a shift in control, while a definitive loss of the $2.00 support could invite a retest of lower levels.",
