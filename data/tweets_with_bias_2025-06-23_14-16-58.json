    "text": "WHAT THE U.S.‚ÄìIRAN ESCALATION MEANS FOR MARKETS\n\nI hate that part of this job is trying to map market outcomes onto human tragedy. That we have to sit here and analyze airstrikes and escalation risk like they‚Äôre just variables in a model. But the truth is, when events like this unfold, people look for some sense of what might come next. And I do think it‚Äôs part of my duty to speak clearly -- even when the subject is this heavy.\n\nWhat we saw wasn‚Äôt just a strike. It was a signal. The U.S. targeted nuclear facilities -- not civilians, not leadership -- which tells me the goal was to remove the most dangerous variable from the equation. And if that was successful, then the worst-case scenario -- the true left tail risk -- is off the table. Not the violence, not the pain, but the unthinkable.\n\nThat doesn‚Äôt mean this is over. I don‚Äôt believe one strike and one backchannel agreement will be the final chapter here. I still think we‚Äôll see retaliation. Maybe an attack on a U.S. base. Maybe something calibrated to make a point without crossing a fatal line. But I also think the market is starting to price that kind of controlled escalation differently than it would a total spiral.\n\nAnd that matters -- especially for names positioned at the intersection of autonomy, cybersecurity, surveillance, and defense modernization. The world is waking up to the fact that 21st century conflict won‚Äôt just be about boots on the ground or missiles in the air. It‚Äôll be about data, infrastructure, and deterrence. That‚Äôs exactly where companies like $PLTR, $AXON, $CRWD, $RBRK, $NET, and $ACHR operate.\n\nThis is why I‚Äôve been quietly building this New Age of Defense bucket in my growth portfolio throughout the recent market pullback. Not because I was predicting escalation, but because the writing‚Äôs been on the wall for years: global instability is no longer the exception -- it‚Äôs the backdrop. And the companies positioned to respond, secure, and adapt in real time will earn their premium, conflict or not.\n\nIf this stays within bounds -- if we don‚Äôt see mass casualties or civilian targets -- then investors will likely interpret it not as peace, but as containment. And that‚Äôs often enough to shift positioning. Not because people are desensitized. Not because they don‚Äôt care. But because $QQQ & $SPY react to what‚Äôs likely, not what‚Äôs just. And when uncertainty narrows, capital moves.\n\nWe‚Äôre not out of the woods. But we‚Äôre no longer staring into the abyss.\n\nBut I hope I‚Äôm wrong in needing to analyze any of this. I hope the story shifts again -- not toward more escalation, but toward diplomacy. Because there‚Äôs no upside in conflict. There‚Äôs only cost.",
