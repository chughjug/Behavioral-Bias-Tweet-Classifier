It's not enough to say it will happen, but it's rapidly moving in that direction.\n\nThis is occurring when there has been little economic news to influence monetary policy. If anything, Powell's testimony over the last two days has attempted to close the door on immediate rate cuts. The market is not listening.\n\nEarlier today, President Trump made this known at his NATO Press Conference:\n\nPresident Donald Trump says he has three or four people in mind to succeed Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell when his term expires next year.\n\nThis sets up the June payroll (July 3) and CPI (July 15) reports as critical for near-term monetary policy. If either or both are weaker than expected, this will turn the pressure white hot for a July cut. Trump is close to picking Powell's successor, and if potential candidates scream loud enough for that cut, they might get Trump's attention and get the nod.\n\nRestated, if either payrolls or CPI are weak, Powell will be the blood in the water, and the sharks will be those wanting Trump to pick them to replace him.",

    "text": "The distribution rate = Latest distribution annualized / current NAV\n\nThe 30-day SEC yield is a standardized measure of the income earned by a fund, typically a bond fund or ETF, over a 30-day period, annualized to provide an estimated annual return.\n* The Distribution Rate and 30-Day SEC Yield is not indicative of future distributions, if any, on the ETFs. In particular, future distributions on any ETF may differ significantly from its Distribution Rate or 30-Day SEC Yield. You are not guaranteed a distribution under the ETFs. Distributions for the ETFs (if any) are variable and may vary significantly from month to month and may be zero. Accordingly, the Distribution Rate and 30-Day SEC Yield will change over time, and such change may be significant. The distribution may include a combination of ordinary dividends, capital gain, and return of investor capital, which may decrease a fund‚Äôs NAV and trading price over time. As a result, an investor may suffer significant losses to their investment. These distribution rates caused by unusually favorable market conditions may not be sustainable. Such conditions may not continue to exist and there should be no expectation that this performance may be repeated in the future. Stated distribution frequency subject to change.
