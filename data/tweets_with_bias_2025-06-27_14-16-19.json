    "text": "The distribution rate = Latest distribution annualized / current NAV\n\nThe 30-day SEC yield is a standardized measure of the income earned by a fund, typically a bond fund or ETF, over a 30-day period, annualized to provide an estimated annual return.\n\n* The Distribution Rate and 30-Day SEC Yield is not indicative of future distributions, if any, on the ETFs. In particular, future distributions on any ETF may differ significantly from its Distribution Rate or 30-Day SEC Yield. You are not guaranteed a distribution under the ETFs. Distributions for the ETFs (if any) are variable and may vary significantly from month to month and may be zero. Accordingly, the Distribution Rate and 30-Day SEC Yield will change over time, and such change may be significant. The distribution may include a combination of ordinary dividends, capital gain, and return of investor capital, which may decrease a fund‚Äôs NAV and trading price over time. As a result, an investor may suffer significant losses to their investment. These distribution rates caused by unusually favorable market conditions may not be sustainable. Such conditions may not continue to exist and there should be no expectation that this performance may be repeated in the future. Stated distribution frequency subject to change.

Current performance may be lower or higher than the performance data quoted.
