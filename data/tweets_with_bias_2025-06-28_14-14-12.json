    "text": "IS AI COMING FOR YOUR JOB? \n\nI get asked this all the time -- isn’t AI going to kill software jobs? And I get why people ask. It’s a logical question on the surface. If AI can write code, why do you need engineers? If an LLM can build your front-end, generate test cases, and spin up infrastructure, doesn’t that mean the talent market just imploded?\n\nBut that’s a misunderstanding of how business -- and capital -- actually works.\n\nBecause in the real world, productivity doesn’t reduce headcount. It reallocates resources. When a CEO sees that one engineer is now delivering what used to take a team of ten, they don’t think, great, I’ll cut my workforce by 90%. They think, finally, I can build everything we couldn’t justify before. That’s not fantasy -- that’s history. That’s what happens every time the cost of creation drops and the return on talent explodes. \n\nGo back to the Industrial Revolution. People thought the steam engine would destroy labor -- and in some ways, it did. The work changed. Manual weavers were displaced. But what came next was an explosion of industry, logistics, cities, and trade. New roles appeared that no one could’ve imagined -- engineers, factory managers, supply chain operators. The economy didn’t shrink. It scaled.\n\nSame with the assembly line. When $F introduced it, critics said it would de-skill workers and eliminate craftsmanship. What actually happened? Car prices dropped, wages went up, and an entire middle class emerged -- built on a foundation of mass-scale productivity.\n\nOr take the rise of personal computing. In the '80s, fears swirled that office jobs would disappear. Spreadsheets would kill accounting. Word processors would kill secretaries. But PCs didn’t destroy work. They amplified it. Every business function -- finance, sales, HR -- suddenly operated at higher velocity. That wasn’t the end of the workforce. It was the start of knowledge work as we know it.\n\nFast forward to cloud computing. It was supposed to make IT departments obsolete. Instead, it made startups possible. The idea that a company could go from idea to global scale without owning a single server changed everything -- and unlocked the explosion of SaaS, e-commerce, and mobile.\n\nAI fits into this lineage. It reduces friction. It collapses time. It makes individual contributors exponentially more powerful. And when you unlock that kind of leverage, the rational response isn’t to cut -- it’s to scale.\n\nYes, some forms of labor will vanish. Entry-level tasks, boilerplate scripting, manual QA -- they’ll get compressed, automated, abstracted away. But that doesn’t mean less work. It means DIFFERENT work. Higher-leverage work. Work that requires judgment, creativity, and the ability to orchestrate AI systems like instruments, not just push buttons on them. The best engineers won’t just be coders -- they’ll be conductors. The same goes for designers, marketers, ops people, analysts. The future isn’t about doing less. It’s about multiplying what one person can do.\n\nAnd here’s the part everyone misses: when output per head rises, companies don’t shrink. They scale. Because now the economics make sense. Now, a startup doesn’t need a hundred people to go from prototype to product. A five-person team with access to the right models can build, test, launch, and scale faster than a fifty-person org ever could. That’s not a thought experiment -- it’s already happening. The companies that win in this era won’t be the ones with the biggest headcount. They’ll be the ones that learned to make every head count more.\n\nSo when new grads worry that there’s no place for them, the answer isn’t to retreat. It’s to adapt. Learn the tools. Use the models. Stop optimizing your resume for a role that GPT can do, and start figuring out how to build the things GPT makes possible. This is the most asymmetric playing field we’ve ever had. The barriers to building have collapsed. A billion-dollar company can now be started by a handful of people and a few fine-tuned prompts. That’s unprecedented. And it flips the risk-reward equation for an entire generation.\n\nAI won’t kill ambition. It just rewrites what it takes to compete.",

    "text": "The distribution rate = Latest distribution annualized / current NAV\n\nThe 30-day SEC yield is a standardized measure of the income earned by a fund, typically a bond fund or ETF, over a 30-day period, annualized to provide an estimated annual return.\n\n* The Distribution Rate and 30-Day SEC Yield is not indicative of future distributions, if any, on the ETFs. In particular, future distributions on any ETF may differ significantly from its Distribution Rate or 30-Day SEC Yield. You are not guaranteed a distribution under the ETFs. Distributions for the ETFs (if any) are variable and may vary significantly from month to month and may be zero. Accordingly, the Distribution Rate and 30-Day SEC Yield will change over time, and such change may be significant. The distribution may include a combination of ordinary dividends, capital gain, and return of investor capital, which may decrease a fund’s NAV and trading price over time. As a result, an investor may suffer significant losses to their investment. These distribution rates caused by unusually favorable market conditions may not be sustainable. Such conditions may not continue to exist and there should be no expectation that this performance may be repeated in the future. Stated distribution frequency subject to change.
