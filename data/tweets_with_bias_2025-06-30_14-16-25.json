Fast. \n\nTraining costs are collapsing. It’s about to become insanely cheap to go from Point A (raw data) to Point B (real-world output).\n\nThat means one thing: a surge of new AI “cars” hits the road -- apps, agents, copilots -- all moving data to decisions at scale. Everyone’s hitting the road at once.\n\nBut here’s the problem -- the highway isn’t ready.\nGrid capacity. Cooling. Storage. Baseload. It’s not there yet.\n\nThat’s the real bottleneck.\n\nForget the chips and the models for a second -- if the infrastructure breaks, everything breaks.\n\nThat’s why I’m laser-focused on the grid layer.
