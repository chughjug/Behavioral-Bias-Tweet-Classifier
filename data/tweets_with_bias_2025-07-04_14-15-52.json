I’m incredibly excited for this next chapter.\n\nOne takeaway that’s really stuck with me: PERCEPTION IS CURRENCY. You can have all the evidence in the world, but if the market doesn’t see it yet, it doesn’t matter.\n\nI’m seeing the disconnects everywhere:\n• $GOOGL: Everyone’s caught up in the “search is dead” narrative, but that’s surface-level thinking. Google owns the full AI infrastructure stack --TPUs, orchestration, data, models, distribution. In an agentic AI future, that stack becomes the operating layer. They’re not just defensible -- they’re embedded.\n\n• $NVDA: Talk of custom silicon, margin compression, and training demand slowing misses the real point. Nvidia isn’t a chip company -- it’s a platform. CUDA is the most valuable developer ecosystem in AI. As long as the world trains and deploys models, $NVDA remains the control layer for AI. \n\n• $AMD: They don’t need to beat Nvidia. They just need a credible lane. If AMD captures even low double-digit share of the accelerator market, they’re printing cash. MI300 is gaining traction, and hyperscalers want optionality. The TAM is expanding -- they’re in the right place.\n\n• $TSLA: Everyone focuses on car margins. But Tesla is building the only vertically integrated AI network for real-world autonomy. If they get even partway to robotaxi or Optimus scale, the market will have to reprice the entire business model. This isn’t about vehicles -- it’s about AI-native infrastructure for mobility and labor.\n\nThese are just a few Futurum signals I’m seeing -- the perception just hasn’t caught up yet.",
