    "text": "THE STRANGE REALITY OF BEING A $TSLA SHAREHOLDER IN 2025\n\nIt’s been hard to explain what it feels like holding Tesla right now. I haven’t lost conviction in what the company is trying to do -- I still believe it’s one of the most important players in energy, autonomy, and robotics -- but I’d be lying if I said the noise around it hasn’t made me hesitate.\n\nI haven’t added to the position in a while. Not because I think the company has lost its way, but because the surrounding narrative has become so chaotic it’s hard to think clearly about the actual innovation happening inside the business. And when that happens -- when the signal gets drowned out by everything else -- I’ve learned it’s usually a good time to step back and size down.\n\nI get why Elon’s making the moves he’s making. It’s not random. It’s strategic. He’s targeting leverage points that most people overlook -- using the same kind of systems thinking that built Tesla and SpaceX in the first place. But I didn’t invest in a political movement. I invested in a company that was changing the way the world moves and stores energy. And it’s exhausting watching that mission get sidelined in headlines that have nothing to do with autonomous driving or Optimus or Dojo or battery innovation.\n\nThere’s a version of the next two years where Tesla stays laser-focused and delivers. That version is still very much possible. But there’s also a version where politics and media drama keep pulling the narrative off-course. And I don’t know how to price that, other than to stay underexposed and patient.\n\nA lot of what’s happening right now has nothing to do with Tesla’s actual mission -- it’s a context problem, not a fundamentals one. Elon’s public profile is so polarizing that even the most transformative work gets overshadowed. The criticisms -- especially from figures like President Trump -- aren’t rooted in the tech, they’re political theater. And unfortunately, in an attention economy, the noise often wins.\n\nBut the truth is, Tesla is quietly building the neural infrastructure for autonomous mobility and intelligent robotics at global scale. This isn’t about selling cars -- it’s about training fleets, coordinating edge inference, and building a vertically integrated AI network that spans vehicles, humanoids, and energy systems. While the narrative drifts, the real work continues -- and it’s decades ahead of where the rest of the world is even looking. But you’d never know it with the way people talk. The conversation’s stuck in the mud -- personality politics, subsidy arguments, clickbait headlines -- all while Tesla is quietly building the AI network for mobility and robotics. Real autonomy. Real humanoid deployment. Real-time decision loops at the edge. That’s the game. And no one’s paying attention.\n\nI still back the mission. Always have. But belief doesn’t mean blind exposure. When a story gets this noisy -- when execution starts competing with narrative distortion -- I pull back. Not because the fundamentals aren’t there, but because position sizing is how you survive long enough to be right.",
