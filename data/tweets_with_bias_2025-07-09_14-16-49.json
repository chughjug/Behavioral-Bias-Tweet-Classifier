    "text": "WHY $TSLA & XAI NEED TO MERGE YESTERDAY\n\nLook, I get why people are skeptical. It‚Äôs easy to scoff at the idea of another Elon moonshot when headlines are dominated by political distractions. But strip away the noise, and what you‚Äôre left with is one of the most strategically sound, high-leverage moves Tesla could make right now: merging xAI‚Äôs frontier models with Tesla‚Äôs real-world autonomy stack.\n\nThis isn‚Äôt about slapping a chatbot into a car. It‚Äôs about building a native AI agent that can think and act -- locally, in real time -- trained on the most advanced driving dataset on earth. Tesla‚Äôs data flywheel is very real. Every mile driven, every intervention, every edge case -- all of it flows back into Tesla‚Äôs vertically integrated system, from silicon to sensor to software. And that loop tightens further with Dojo, its in-house supercomputer built specifically for this kind of feedback.\n\nNow layer in xAI -- designed from the ground up to run at the edge: low latency, high efficiency, and tightly aligned with Tesla‚Äôs hardware stack built for the physical world.\n\nHere‚Äôs the truth about the new digital economy: you need to own the data, the deployment surface, the silicon -- and now, the models. That only works if you bring xAI under the same roof. Tesla needs xAI‚Äôs model innovation to unlock human-level cognition on-device. xAI needs Tesla‚Äôs deployment scale to keep learning.\n\nAnd this isn‚Äôt just about autonomy. It‚Äôs about the future of inference cost -- the economic backbone of real-world AI. Whether it‚Äôs a car, a robot, a drone, or a smart factory, whoever can run high-fidelity models locally, fast, and cheap... wins. Vertical integration isn‚Äôt optional anymore. It‚Äôs the moat.\n\nSo yes, I think this merger would be a major win for shareholders -- not just as a narrative reset to offset the political overhang on the stock, but because it structurally aligns Tesla to build the first full-stack AI operating system for the physical world.\n\nAnd in my view, this move is inevitable.",

I got you. \n\nYou need co-bots or follow-me robots for routine tasks?  I got you there as well.\n\nNeed AI to streamline your business or your life?  Some of the world‚Äôs largest companies are working on that as we speak.\n\nHowever, I have some tough news for you: a humanoid robot (or any type of robot) is not going to build your house, data center, cell phone tower, or wire up all of the fancy robotic systems I design.  \n\nThat work will be done by the trades‚Ä¶ for the rest of your life.\n\nGen 4 nuclear?  Electricians and welders. \n\nHousing affordability?  Electricians and HVAC technicians.\n\nManufacturing plant?  Concrete, steel erection, welding, fire protection, electrical, plumbing, millwright, painting, metrology, and more. \n\nDrill baby drill?  Rough necks need to work the fields. \n\nFollowing the trades shortage closely is engineering.  Not computer programmers or software developers. I mean engineers that design things‚Ä¶ that get built.\n\nThe national unemployment rate for licensed electricians, certified HVAC technicians, certified welders, licensed  plumbers, and  professional engineers is about 1.5%.\n\nSimply out, we have no more supply.\n\nIf the OBBB delivers the boom to our economy and infrastructure that it promises we are woefully unprepared. \n\nYoung people: join the trades NOW. Love math or problem solving?  Engineering school.\n\nGeneral contractors: sign up a labor minimum from your favorite trades contractors now!\n\nProcurement teams: get your long lead items (transformers, switch gear, equipment, robotics, automation, and steel) locked in ASAP.\n\nHumanoids won‚Äôt solve this. AI won‚Äôt solve this. LinkedIn direct marketing and cold email outreach won‚Äôt solve this. \n\nAI agents might help‚Ä¶ you be more efficient. \n\nBut America need bodies.  Skilled bodies. \n\nOn top of that, many of our foreign worker friends are going home soon.  The new labor numbers show a net change of 3 million jobs shift between foreign and domestic workers‚Ä¶ in Q2 2025!  Let the numbers keep running at this pace and we‚Äôre in for a rude awakening.\n\nLet the foreign investment in the USA manifest and there will be intense competition for skilled trades. \n\nLet housing boom with deregulation and wait for the shortages.\n\nLet major infrastructure projects begin and see if there are delays due to labor and equipment availability.\n\nLet manufacturing re-shore and watch as the plant floor and the trade contractors compete for the same people. \n\nFor those on this app that yearn for a resurgent middle class and single income households -  your dream is about to come true.\n\nFor the PE bros that rolled up trades contractors. Hey, it‚Äôs better to be lucky than good.  You may just get some exits after all. \n\nFor my @GeorgiaTech brothers and sisters that resisted big consulting and actually became a helluva engineer, time to make to rain.  Thanks for your perseverance.\n\nFinally, this is GREAT for the American worker and American companies.  Wages and profits are set to explode. \n\nI can‚Äôt wait to watch.

    "text": "I've been closely observing big breakout stocks like CHEF as \"canary in the coal mine\" indicators, looking for clues to determine if the market's character was shifting toward a more favorable environment for low risk breakout trading. The key words are LOW RISK. Unfortunately, yesterday provided a definitive answer‚Äîthough not the one we hoped for.\n\nIf you are a breakout trader using tight stops - even though the indexes have ripped higher - you have likely experienced a low batting average. \n\nThe frequent occurrence of squats and outright failures continues to dominate as a theme around breakout levels, clearly signaling that conditions remain challenging and volatile around key risk levels.\n\nThese failed breakouts reveal persistent overhead supply and insufficient follow-through from institutional buyers, underscoring a risk off market with regard to broad-based participation. Hence, the continued gravitation to \"old guard\" names.\n\nLike you, I remain an active participant and careful observer, adjusting day by day and ensuring risk management remains my top priority. As far as breakout stocks are concerned, this is NOT yet an Easy Dollar environment. For the most part, we are still fighting for pennies. \n\nFor those who have been willing to allow for a bit more volatility, you are likely experiencing better results. If so, congrats; keep doing what is working for you. \n\nLet me know in the comments if you agree with this assessment and what you are experiencing during this V recovery..",

But we've gone from recession fears to optimism with the major indexes reaching all-time highs and sentiment readings approaching excessive bullishness. That shift leaves the markets vulnerable to a pullback. As sentiment cools off and rates remain stable, a pullback should be contained to 4-7% peak to trough and present a buying opportunity. If we should rally from here without a pullback and sentiment gets more bullish, I would use that as an opportunity to sell into strength and nail down profits, particularly on extended names.",

    "text": "The second quarter of 2025 was one for the history books. After a sharp 12.1% correction in the S&P 500, the index staged its fastest-ever recovery from a 15% drop, finishing the quarter up 10.6% ‚Äì its strongest showing since Q4 of 2023. That type of V-shaped recovery demonstrates the underlying strength of this bull market, despite persistent macro uncertainty.\n\nHowever, President Trump‚Äôs unpredictable trade policies continue to inject volatility into the market. This renewed uncertainty is weighing on consumer confidence, business investment, and overall risk appetite. As a result, money managers have gravitated toward mega-cap ‚Äúold guard‚Äù names while small and mid-cap stocks remain significant underperformers.\n\nCyclical growth sectors have led since the April bottom, with market breadth notably improving into early May. If the Fed delivers a rate cut in September, and tax cuts materialize as expected, cyclical leadership could extend further. Combined with seasonal patterns and typical post-election tailwinds, the setup supports cyclical outperformance through year-end.\n\nMeanwhile, commodities saw turbulent action in Q2, driven by an escalating trade war and U.S. military action against a major OPEC producer. Despite these shocks, the S&P Goldman Sachs Commodity Index (GSCI) ended the quarter down just -4.4%. Precious metals gained 5%, livestock rose 8%, and those moves helped cushion the 9% decline in energy ‚Äì the index‚Äôs largest component.\n\nIn the short term, the popular indexes are extended. Sentiment has flipped sharply from ultra-bearish to very bullish, which is a negative from a contrarian standpoint. However, with oil prices retreating and rates remaining stable, the Goldilocks economy appears undisturbed for now. That suggests this bull market remains sustainable. I expect pullbacks to be contained to the 4-7% range and to provide buyable opportunities for disciplined traders.\n\nAs always, my focus remains on strong relative strength names, tight volatility contraction setups, and stocks breaking out of proper bases with clear volume confirmation. Remember, in bull markets, the key is not to fight the tape but to execute with precision and strict risk control.\n\nStay disciplined and stay alert ‚Äì opportunity always emerges for those prepared.",
