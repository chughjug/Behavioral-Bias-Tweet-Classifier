Yeah, 23 would probably be overkill. But in small-caps, it‚Äôs a different game. You‚Äôre not looking for every name to double -- you‚Äôre looking for a few to 5‚Äì10x. And to find those, you need surface area. You need exposure. Because let‚Äôs be real -- some of these will flame out, and that‚Äôs fine.\n\n‚Ä¢ This is the part of the market where optionality matters more than concentration. I‚Äôd rather own 20+ names I‚Äôve spent real time on and give myself a shot at catching the next $IONQ or $RKLB -- instead of swinging for the fences with 3‚Äì5 names and blowing up if one goes south.\n\n‚Ä¢ I‚Äôm not throwing darts. I size based on conviction, catalysts, timelines -- some are bigger, some are just spec moonshots. But every position earns its keep. And in this space, I‚Äôd argue this is actually risk management, not over-diversification.\n\n‚Ä¢ Could I be wrong on some? Of course. But I‚Äôd rather be wrong small on a few and right big on the ones that matter -- that‚Äôs the whole point of this approach. It‚Äôs not about being perfect, it‚Äôs about surviving long enough to get paid when you‚Äôre right.",

Credit quality is a VERY MINOR driver of their yields.\n\nNominal growth, inflation expectations, and anticipated supply drive the level of sovereign yields. \n\nAll of Trump‚Äôs ‚Äúcredit‚Äù statements are arguments for high nominal growth and heightened inflation expectations.

In particular, future distributions on any ETF may differ significantly from its Distribution Rate or 30-Day SEC Yield. You are not guaranteed a distribution under the ETFs. Distributions for the ETFs (if any) are variable and may vary significantly from month to month and may be zero. Accordingly, the Distribution Rate and 30-Day SEC Yield will change over time, and such change may be significant. The distribution may include a combination of ordinary dividends, capital gain, and return of investor capital, which may decrease a fund‚Äôs NAV and trading price over time. As a result, an investor may suffer significant losses to their investment. These distribution rates caused by unusually favorable market conditions may not be sustainable. Such conditions may not continue to exist and there should be no expectation that this performance may be repeated in the future. Stated distribution frequency subject to change.

Current performance may be lower or higher than the performance data quoted. Investment return and principal value will fluctuate so that an investor‚Äôs shares, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than original cost. Returns less than one year are not annualized. Returns for the fund would have been lower if the management fee had not been waived. NAV prices are used to calculate market price performance prior to the date when the Fund first traded on the NASDAQ. Market performance is determined using the bid/ask midpoint at 4:00 pm Eastern time, when the NAV is typically calculated. Market performance does not represent the returns you would receive if you traded shares at other times. For the fund‚Äôs most recent month end performance, please call 1(844)-476-8747, or visit graniteshares.com \n \nShares are bought and sold at market price (not NAV) and are not individually redeemed from the ETF. There can be no guarantee that an active trading market for ETF shares will develop or be maintained, or that their listing will continue or remain unchanged. Buying or selling ETF shares on an exchange may require the payment of brokerage commissions and frequent trading may incur brokerage costs that detract significantly from investment returns.\n\nInvestors should consider the investment objectives, risks, charges and expenses carefully before investing.

The key words are LOW RISK. Unfortunately, yesterday provided a definitive answer‚Äîthough not the one we hoped for.\n\nIf you are a breakout trader using tight stops - even though the indexes have ripped higher - you have likely experienced a low batting average. \n\nThe frequent occurrence of squats and outright failures continues to dominate as a theme around breakout levels, clearly signaling that conditions remain challenging and volatile around key risk levels.\n\nThese failed breakouts reveal persistent overhead supply and insufficient follow-through from institutional buyers, underscoring a risk off market with regard to broad-based participation. Hence, the continued gravitation to \"old guard\" names.\n\nLike you, I remain an active participant and careful observer, adjusting day by day and ensuring risk management remains my top priority. As far as breakout stocks are concerned, this is NOT yet an Easy Dollar environment. For the most part, we are still fighting for pennies. \n\nFor those who have been willing to allow for a bit more volatility, you are likely experiencing better results. If so, congrats; keep doing what is working for you. \n\nLet me know in the comments if you agree with this assessment and what you are experiencing during this V recovery..",
