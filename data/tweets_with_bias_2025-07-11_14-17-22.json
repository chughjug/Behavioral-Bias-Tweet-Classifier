    "text": "Trump is back with another \"truth\" today making the point I detail yesterday (retweet below).\n\nTrump argues that the US should have the lowest rate because it has the best credit.\n\nI might agree with Trump; the US is the best sovereign CREDIT in the world.\n\nCredit quality, however, is a relatively minor factor in determining sovereign yields. Nominal growth, inflation expectations, and supply determine sovereign yields.\n \nThe rest of his arguments are the same arguments for high nominal growth, higher inflation expectations, and BBB has many worried about more supply.\n\nAll these points to higher yields. \n---\nCredit is the ability to repay a debt.\n\nThe US has the ability to \"print\" money to repay all its debt. Therefore, it will never default.\n\nThe problem is those \"printed\" dollars will be immediately devalued, otherwise known as inflation. \n\nUnder this scenario, it raises inflation expectations and sovereign yields go up. But you are still the best CREDIT in the world.",

And what do we do? We crawl back and keep giving them our money.\n\nThat‚Äôs exactly why mediocrity thrives. We tolerate it. We‚Äôve become a society so complacent, so spineless, that we keep rewarding incompetence and disrespect. People and businesses that should have failed long ago are thriving simply because we let them.\n\nThat‚Äôs not how I operate. Never has been, never will be. But watching this circus unfold?
