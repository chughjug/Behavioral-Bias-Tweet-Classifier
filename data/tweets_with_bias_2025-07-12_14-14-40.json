It shouldn't be about the why. It really shouldn't. If you trust the process.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúI didn't tell it when to be done. The signal told me when to act.‚Äù\n\nStay with the signal.

Anthropic, Azure's GenAI and non-GenAI strength as supply eased, and our CIO survey give us more conviction in AWS acceleration ahead. We raise our price target to $300 (35% upside) and set a $350 bull case (60% upside). Amazon remains our top pick.\n\nThe macro backdrop has significantly improved since mid-April when we published Amazon Inc: Analyzing 6 Factors of Uncertainty and Remaining Overweight (April 13, 2025), where we reduced our AMZN estimates to account for a potential 145% China tariff. Today, we are re-raising our estimates as we adjust for the more constructive macro landscape with lower tariffs. Our 2026/2027 EPS rises to $8/$9, with our new $8 of 2026 EPS in line with our prior estimates from 1Q25 before the China tariff concerns.\"\n\nAnalyst: Brian Nowak",
