While SpaceX goes big, Rocket Lab is going modular, vertical, and defense-aligned.\n\nThey‚Äôve quietly built one of the most comprehensive space infrastructure stacks in the world:\n\n‚Ä¢ Launch (Electron, Neutron)\n‚Ä¢ Satellite components (solar arrays, reaction wheels, propulsion)\n‚Ä¢ Constellation integration (LEO networks, DoD payloads)\n‚Ä¢ End-to-end mission services\n\nThis isn‚Äôt a launch company. It‚Äôs a vertically integrated space logistics firm -- and the U.S. government has noticed. Their $515M SDA contract for a secure satellite constellation, their work with Transportation Command for rapid orbital cargo, and their acquisition spree (SolAero, Sinclair, Advanced Solutions) are strategic positioning moves. They're not chasing margins -- they‚Äôre building a moat.\n\nIn the post-Starlink era, space isn‚Äôt about who gets up there fastest.

ASTS partners with carriers, not competes with them. And their patented technology allows for direct-to-device broadband, solving the global dead zone problem with zero user friction.\n\nThe genius here isn‚Äôt the hardware. It‚Äôs the distribution model. ASTS doesn‚Äôt need to onboard new customers. They ride the rails of existing carriers --  AT&T, Vodafone, Rakuten -- and expand coverage instantly. That‚Äôs the difference between a consumer sell and a B2B scale engine.\n\nBlock 2 is finalized. Manufacturing is in motion. First commercial services are on deck.

This isn‚Äôt a utility. It‚Äôs a power appliance -- modular, dispatchable, and built for an always-on AI era.\n\nThe Aurora design is already in front of the NRC. The Idaho National Lab site is live. And with DoD partnerships already locked in, Oklo isn‚Äôt just building clean power -- they‚Äôre building strategic infrastructure.\n\nBut make no mistake -- it‚Äôs early, and the stock isn‚Äôt cheap. The revenue timelines are still years out, and nuclear development is notoriously slow-moving. \n\nStill, the inevitability is real. AI won‚Äôt scale without local, stable, high-density energy.
