There‚Äôs no beehives, and there‚Äôs no roof terrace gardens.\"\n---\nTechnically, Powell is correct because the renovation has not been completed. However, such details are outlined in some plans for the renovations.\n\nIs this a big deal? No. However, if Trump is looking for ANY reason to remove Powell, this might be enough. And it might be enough \"for cause\" that the Supreme Court will uphold it. \n\nFurthermore, no one in Congress wants to spend any political capital defending a $2.5 billion marble Washington, D.C. building with private elevators, beehives, and private roof terraces.\n---\nBottom line, Powell may have given Trump an opening to remove him.
