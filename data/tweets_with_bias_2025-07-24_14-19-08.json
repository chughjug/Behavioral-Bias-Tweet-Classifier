In particular, future distributions on any ETF may differ significantly from its Distribution Rate or 30-Day SEC Yield. You are not guaranteed a distribution under the ETFs.

The distribution may include a combination of ordinary dividends, capital gain, and return of investor capital, which may decrease a fund‚Äôs NAV and trading price over time.
