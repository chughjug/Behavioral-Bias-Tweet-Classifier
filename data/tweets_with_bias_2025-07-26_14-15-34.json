    "text": "HERE‚ÄôS WHAT ANALYSTS HAVE TO SAY AFTER $TSLA Q2 EARNINGS:\n\nTD Cowen (Buy, PT: $374)\n‚ÄúQ2 was in-line overall. Encouraging AV updates but unsurprising near-term earnings pressure. Tesla‚Äôs AV progress and product pipeline are too significant to ignore given the widely acknowledged EPS headwinds. Maintain tactical Buy.‚Äù\n\nBenchmark (Buy, PT: $475)\n‚ÄúTSLA reported revenue of $22.5B vs. our $22.6B estimate and consensus $22.1B. GAAP EPS was $0.33, above consensus $0.30. Gross margin was 17%, also ahead. Despite near-term headwinds‚Äîtariffs, promotional pricing, warranty costs‚ÄîTesla continues to execute in autonomy, AI, and energy. Investors should look beyond the noise toward upcoming catalysts: affordable vehicle ramp, robotaxi revenue in 2H26, and at-scale Optimus production. Maintain Buy.‚Äù\n\nStifel (Buy, PT: $450)\n‚Äú2Q results were neutral. Positives: launch and expansion of robotaxis in Austin; production of lower-priced vehicle ramping (albeit slower); cost-per-vehicle improvements; confidence in unsupervised FSD by year-end. Negatives: weak deliveries and tariff impact; muted guidance; urgency to deliver before tax credit expiry. We believe FSD and Robotaxi remain core value drivers.‚Äù\n\nPiper Sandler (Overweight, PT: $400)\n‚ÄúWe remain Overweight. Despite post-earnings drop (~5%), results were solid. Investors may have misread Musk's comment on the next vehicle resembling Model Y‚Äîbut with FSD in play, vehicle form matters less. Musk warned of rough quarters ahead as subsidies fade, but FSD expansion to half the US in 2026 outweighs near-term concerns.‚Äù\n\nMizuho (Outperform, PT: $375)\n‚ÄúResults in line: $22.5B revenue, $0.40 EPS. Auto GMs ex-ZEV credits beat at ~15%. Tesla didn‚Äôt guide FY25 deliveries, citing trade/fiscal volatility. Deliveries fell ~14% y/y; H2 may improve. With EV subsidies expiring, Tesla must prioritize affordability and volume. Positioned well in AV/Robotics, despite short-term demand challenges.‚Äù\n\nCantor Fitzgerald (Overweight, PT: $355)\n‚ÄúResults were mild: revenue and margins beat, but FCF missed by ~$200M. No annual guidance or robotaxi update. Still, we‚Äôre encouraged by: lower-priced vehicle production (began June), Cybercab remains on track, and core margin beat (15.3% ex-reg). Bullish ahead of key catalysts: robotaxi city expansion (Q4), FSD rollout in China and Europe.‚Äù\n\nCanaccord Genuity (Buy, PT: $333)\n‚ÄúRaise PT to $333, based on ~38x 2027E EPS. While the target implies limited upside, we believe Tesla‚Äôs long-term opportunity set across EV, autonomy, energy, and robotics justifies our premium multiple. Reaffirm Buy given volatility short-term but transformational upside long-term.‚Äù\n\nBarclays (Equalweight, PT: $275)\n‚ÄúMusk reiterated Tesla‚Äôs ambition beyond auto‚Äîrobotaxi, Optimus, AI. Still, fundamentals remain choppy. Expiring US EV credits, reduced regulatory credits, and pushed timelines for the low-cost model all present near-term hurdles. While the AI story is intact, near-term delivery and margin risks persist.‚Äù\n\nOppenheimer (Perform, PT: N/A)\n‚ÄúBetter-than-expected auto GMs; overall results in-line. Company emphasized autonomy and AI, but avoided detail on xAI. Optimus ramp remains vague. Autonomy performance improving, but regulation remains a hurdle. We see prudent delay in ramping lower-cost model post-subsidy. Remain on sidelines awaiting clearer AI monetization visibility.‚Äù\n\nTruist (Hold, PT: $280)\n‚ÄúRevs and EPS in-line, but mgmt acknowledged that tariffs and credit changes could pressure metrics in coming quarters. Little detail was offered on lower-priced cars, Dojo, FSD, or Optimus‚Äîmaking forecasts more speculative. Our DCF-based PT remains $280.‚Äù\n\nBaird (Neutral, PT: $320)\n‚ÄúSlightly better than low expectations. Energy business was a pleasant surprise. Commentary was mixed‚Äîrobotaxi timelines reiterated, Optimus timelines delayed. Key concern: how long does Tesla get a pass on delays? Neutral due to near-term financial focus.‚Äù\n\nUBS (Sell, PT: $215)\n‚ÄúTSLA outlook remains challenged: EV credit expiration, brand issues in Europe/China, and high competition. New models appear to be Model Y variants‚Äîdemand uplift questionable. Lower FY26 EPS to $1.85 (from $2.24), ~18% below consensus. While AV and humanoids are progressing, estimate downgrades may pressure shares near term.‚Äù\n\nHSBC (Reduce, PT: $120)\n‚ÄúQ2 marks 11th EBIT miss in 12 quarters. More tough quarters ahead: US tariffs ($300M), ending incentives, and slower-than-guided ramp of affordable models. Tesla's problems appear structural‚Äîaging product line, growing competition, and brand issues. Lower FY25/FY26 OP forecasts by 27% and 23%.‚Äù",
