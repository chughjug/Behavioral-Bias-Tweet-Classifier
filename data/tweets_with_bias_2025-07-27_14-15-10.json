    "text": "MY THOUGHTS ON $SOFI & $HOOD EARNINGS NEXT WEEK\n\nQ2 might be noisy for both names. Neither SoFi nor Robinhood is likely to wow on bottom-line metrics -- but that‚Äôs missing the bigger picture. These aren‚Äôt hype-driven fintechs anymore. They‚Äôre building real infrastructure for the future of consumer finance. If you're betting on platforms that digitally native consumers will actually use over the next decade, this is where the puck is headed.\n\nHeading into earnings, here‚Äôs what I‚Äôm watching:\n\n‚Ä¢ For SoFi: I want to see continued outperformance in the financial services segment -- this is the high-margin, fee-based engine that proves SoFi can scale beyond lending. Product adds above 1M and member growth above 700k would reinforce that the flywheel is intact. I'm also watching net interest margin closely -- if it holds near 6%, despite macro headwinds, it confirms their deposit funding advantage is real and durable. Finally, any color on new Galileo or Technisys partnerships would be a signal that the tech platform is starting to drive meaningful B2B upside.\n\n‚Ä¢ For Robinhood: Robinhood needs to prove that monetization per user is trending up -- not just through trading, but via subscriptions, margin, and retirement flows. Growth in Gold subs above 3.5M and signs that retirement AUM is scaling beyond $15B would show the wealth flywheel is building. I‚Äôm also tracking the impact of Bitstamp ahead of full integration: are crypto volumes accelerating, and is there cross-pollination between core Robinhood users and the new international crypto base? And lastly, EBITDA margins above 50% would signal they're executing on growth without bloating the cost base.",
