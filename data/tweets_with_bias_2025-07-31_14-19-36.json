    "text": "The distribution rate = Latest distribution annualized / current NAV\n\nThe 30-day SEC yield is a standardized measure of the income earned by a fund, typically a bond fund or ETF, over a 30-day period, annualized to provide an estimated annual return.\n\n* The Distribution Rate and 30-Day SEC Yield is not indicative of future distributions, if any, on the ETFs. In particular, future distributions on any ETF may differ significantly from its Distribution Rate or 30-Day SEC Yield. You are not guaranteed a distribution under the ETFs. Distributions for the ETFs (if any) are variable and may vary significantly from month to month and may be zero. Accordingly, the Distribution Rate and 30-Day SEC Yield will change over time, and such change may be significant. The distribution may include a combination of ordinary dividends, capital gain, and return of investor capital, which may decrease a fund’s NAV and trading price over time.
