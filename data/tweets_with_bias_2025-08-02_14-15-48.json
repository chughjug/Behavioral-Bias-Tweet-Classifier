    "text": "MY $AMD EARNINGS PREVIEW: WHY THIS QUARTER MATTERS MORE THAN EVER\n\nI think we‚Äôre about to see the most important earnings print in AMD‚Äôs history -- not because Q2 will be flawless, but because it‚Äôs the clearest test yet of whether AMD‚Äôs AI transformation has teeth. The business is evolving fast. And the way the market re-rates this name over the next 12‚Äì18 months will hinge on how AMD threads the needle between growth and profitability at a platform scale.\n\nMargins Will Dip, but That‚Äôs Not the Point\n\nLet‚Äôs be clear: margins will still be under pressure. Gross margins could fall to 52% due to a mix of high-bandwidth memory costs, 5nm packaging, and ROCm ecosystem investments. That‚Äôs to be expected when you‚Äôre ramping a next-gen AI platform from scratch. But underneath that margin compression is something far more important -- AMD is starting to price like a leader, scale like a leader, and land contracts like a leader. \n\nFrom Underdog to Platform Contender\n\nThe MI350 pricing bump from $15K to $25K is a flashing signal to the street. This is no longer a ‚Äúbudget‚Äù option to $NVDA Blackwell stack. It‚Äôs a viable, competitive product with real performance credentials, being adopted at scale by hyperscalers like $ORCL and major inference users like $TSLA. And it's backed by a growing ROCm ecosystem with better compiler support, Hugging Face integrations, and day-one $META LLaMA 4 readiness. When you combine that with the fact that AMD is already taking CPU share from $INTC on both the client and server side, and layering in rack-scale design capabilities via the ZT Systems acquisition, the strategic picture becomes clearer: AMD is building a full-stack, disaggregated alternative to the vertically integrated AI infra model.\n\nThe Optionality Is What‚Äôs Explosive\n\nThat‚Äôs why I‚Äôm more excited about AMD than I‚Äôve ever been. But because the optionality in the model is exploding. GPU revenue could exceed $4B this year. AI as a % of total revenue is rising. The data center segment is approaching 50% of total business. And while consensus still models a trough in Q2, the ramp into H2 looks like the beginning of a multi-year compounding engine -- especially if AMD nails the MI355X launch and reopens MI308X shipments to China.\n\nA Re-Rating Moment in the Making?\n\nThis quarter is less about the numbers and more about whether the market finally accepts AMD as more than a challenger. If management guides Q3 revenue above $8B and shows any signs of margin re-expansion, the market will have to start pricing this company as a legitimate AI infrastructure platform -- one that offers hyperscalers flexibility, pricing leverage, and a non-CUDA path to LLM scaling. That shift in perception, combined with already rising demand for MI-series chips, is what could justify a move toward $200+ over the next 12 months.\n\nBottom line: I don‚Äôt expect a melt-up on earnings. The stock is extended, RSI is hot, and any in-line guide could lead to a short-term fade. But this is the first time in AMD‚Äôs history where every part of the business -- CPUs, GPUs, software, system design -- is moving in the same direction.",

That‚Äôs not saturation -- that‚Äôs the early innings of migration.\n\nAnd this isn‚Äôt just about training LLMs. It‚Äôs about every enterprise app going AI-native.

It runs in the cloud -- and it runs on clouds built for AI.\n\nSo no, I don‚Äôt buy the ‚Äúcapex cliff‚Äù story. Not when we‚Äôre staring at a $2T+ cloud market that‚Äôs still mostly untapped.

    "text": "It is never the data, it is the markets reaction to the data that is important.\n\nI think the tell for today‚Äôs weakness in hindsight, which fortunately is always perfect, may have started on Wednesday, when despite 2 Fed governors dissenting and wanting to cut rates, the press conference was taken as bearish and the S&P closed slightly down for the day.\n\nThen yesterday, the stock of AI darling $NVDA goes down 1% & the S&P declines from an up open to finish down 0.4% despite big Azure numbers from $MSFT driving their stock +4% and $META up 11% on using AI the best to run their business. This was the biggest surprise to me of all the Mag7 results this week. Meta did not raise the high-end of their capex and expense guidance despite raising the low-end for each.\n\nAnd now today, instead of the market cheering a weak jobs number, \"great the Fed can cut\", it is instead \"oh no, the Fed has to cut.\" Also $AAPL is down today despite reporting revs up 10% y/y which was the best since the covid driven CQ4:2021. While my preview was that they would have a strong quarter, I also am not surprised the stock is down today given: 1) their disclosure around AI again was once again underwhelming, which I thought would be the main driver of the stock today, 2) I think the demand pull-in is much more than the 1% Apple believes, 3) the $GOOGL anti-trust remedies are coming in August which will impact over $20B in pure profits for Apple and 4) given the high bar Microsoft and Meta set the day before. $AMZN deserves its stock decline today given disappointing revs & profitability at AWS which was the concern I previewed despite stellar results in e-commerce.\n\nFinally, President Trump seems to be emboldened by the stock market hitting all-time record highs despite the tariff rates announced over the past couple of weeks closer to the high-teens instead of the baseline 10% the market was expecting early this year and low teens recently. Furthermore, sending two nuclear submarines towards Russia is not something anyone wants to see.\n\nSo where does that leave us? Monday should be telling. Do investors go home over the weekend and decide this is yet another buying opportunity given the Fed is likely to cut in September or do they decide a higher tariff rate that was stressing the stock market out earlier in the year is an issue? I still tend to believe the market wants to melt-up into Thanksgiving for the reasons I have laid out before of impending Fed rate cuts, demand pull-in and a weaker US dollar helping S&P revenues. After a continuing melt-up, I have been expecting a 10-20% stock market decline from Thanksgiving to year-end as the impact of the demand pull-in is fully realized during disappointing holiday sales. But is the stock action this week telling me the decline has already started?\n\nI still believe new stock market highs are ahead of us though the current decline may have a bit more to go. I am betting on ‚Äúirrational exuberance‚Äù in the near-term but maybe I am the one being irrational.",

The Fed said we was attending to a \"personal matter.\" Two days later, she steps down. (Kugler's last day is August 8.)\n\nI wish her well.\n---\nKugler's seat as a Fed governor was going to end in January 2026. She was not going to be reappointed as Trump needs this seat to appoint Powell's successor (unless he picks current Fed Governor Chris Waller).\n\nTrump can now nominate Powell's successor at any time and demand that the Senate confirm his nominee before the next FOMC meeting on September 17.  This means the FOMC will have AT LEAST three solid votes to cut rates.\n\nIn my opinion, the probability that Trump will move to fire Powell, most likely \"for cause,\" around the renovation of the Fed buildings, is 45%.  This is less than 50%, but significantly higher than the betting markets currently have it, at around 15%.\n\nFurthermore, I suggest that Powell's firing will likely hinge on his speech at Jackson Hole at the end of the month.\n\nIf Powell opens the door to a September cut, Trump will not fire him.\n\nIf Powell pushes back on a September cut, Trump will move to fire him.\n\nPowell will not leave, and they will go to court to sort this out.
